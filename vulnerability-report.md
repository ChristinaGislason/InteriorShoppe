## Vulnerability 1: HTTPS

Exposure
HTTPS is a secure communications channel that is used to exchange information between a client computer and a server. 
It uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). It requires the configuration of the SSL/HTTPS service in Internet Information Services (IIS) and compares this process to the similar process in Apache.

HTTPS prevents intruders from compromising communications between a website and its usersâ€™ browsers. Intruders can include: malicious attackers, legitimate but intrusive companies, like ISPs or hotels that inject ads.

Intruders take advantage of unprotected communications to foil users into providing sensitive data or installing malware, or insert their own ads into your resources.

## Vulnerability 2: User Secrets

Exposure
Storing passwords in a plain text file is insecure. For example, a database connection string stored in appsettings.json may include a password for a specified user. A more secure approach is to store the password as a secret.

The app's secrets.json file should contain the secrets.

## Vulnerability 3: Encryption

Exposure
Never write your own encryption; our app uses the User Manager class and CreateAsync method for creating users with a specified password which then hashes the password. By doing this, if someone gained access to the database, they would not be able to retrieve the users' passwords.

Sample code from InteriorShoppe AccountController.cs:

                var result = await _userManager.CreateAsync(user, rvm.Password);

## Vulnerability 4: Data Access

Exposure
Using Entity Framework is an effective SQL injection prevention mechanism. SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, and that might destroy your database. It is one of the most common web hacking techniques placing malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input. However, with Entity Framework, we use LINQ to SQL that helps prevent SQL injection.

LINQ to SQL helps to stop SQL injection, because it passes all data to the database via SQL parameters. LINQ queries are not composed by using string manipulation or concatenation, that's why they are not susceptible to traditional SQL injection attacks.

Sample LINQ query from InteriorShoppe BasketService.cs:

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets Basket by the user's ID
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="userID">User's ID</param>
        /// <returns>Basket</returns>
        public async Task<List<Basket>> GetBasket(string userID)
        {
            var basketItems = await _context.Basket.Where(b => b.UserID == userID).ToListAsync();
            basketItems.ForEach(item => item.Furniture = _context.Furniture.Find(item.FurnitureID));
            return basketItems;
        }
