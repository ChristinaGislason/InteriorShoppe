## Vulnerability 1: Using HTTPS

Exposure
HTTPS is a secure communications channel that is used to exchange information between a client computer and a server. 
It uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). It requires the configuration of the SSL/HTTPS service in Internet Information Services (IIS) and compares this process to the similar process in Apache.

HTTPS prevents intruders from compromising communications between a website and its usersâ€™ browsers. Intruders can include: malicious attackers, legitimate but intrusive companies, like ISPs or hotels that inject ads.

Intruders take advantage of unprotected communications to foil users into providing sensitive data or installing malware, or insert their own ads into your resources.

## Vulnerability 2: Using User Secrets

Exposure
Storing passwords in a plain text file is insecure. For example, a database connection string stored in appsettings.json may include a password for a specified user. A more secure approach is to store the password as a secret.

The app's secrets.json file should contain the secrets.
