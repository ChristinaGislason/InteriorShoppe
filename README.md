# THE WRIGHT STUFF

401 ECommerce Store by Brian Nelson and Christina Gislason

Project: The Wright Stuff, an Interior Shoppe 

## DESCRIPTION

Our team created an ECommerce furnishings store that specializes in mid-century modern-inspired
interiors. Users are able to register for an account, log-in/log-out from their account, and 
view all items in the store's inventory. 

## CHALLENGE

#### Milestone 1/
Properly setup Azure Dev Ops as a Project Management Tool in order to organize tasks efficiently;
Build out the skeleton of an MVC site with a Home Controller and use SQL Server as our database;
Deploy both database and web app to Azure;

#### Milestone 2/
Utilize and enable ASP.NET Core identity API so the site is secure for users;
Ensure users can register for an account on the site, so they have a personalized experience;
Utilize the repository design pattern to easily switch between production and development 
environments;
Seed at least 10 products in the database for initial launch of the site;

#### Milestone 3/

Allow user to login to the website on a custom secure login page;
Capture custom claims upon registration of the site;
Greet user with a custom home page when they visit the site;
User can either login or register easily through a link on the home page;
User should be greeted, after login, with their first and last name;

#### Milestone 4/

Implement a custom claims-based policy;
Ensure part of the site is only accessible to those who meet the criteria for a specific policy;
Create a page where visitors can view all the products in the store's inventory so that 
they can eventually make purchase(s).

## WORK PLAN

We worked on breaking down the project requirements by utilizing the Azure DevOps project management tool.
Each UserStory was added to the board and further broken down into smaller tasks. There UserStories 
belonged to a larger iteration of a weekly sprint.
Each partner was tasked with a unique UserStory and the corresponding tasks would be individual partner's responsibility.
We frequently referenced the board to check on the status of our project and to ensure we were staying
on top of our timeline.

## GIT PROCESS

Our Git Flow required each partner to check out new branches for each individual task.
When a pull request was made, it was the responsibility of the other partner to review, then merge the branch. 
In order to minimize merge conflicts, our team worked on a beta branch that was checked out weekly for 
each new weekly sprint.
